print('''I will always remember the day you kissed my lips
light as a feather ,and it went just like this
no , it's never been better than the summer of 2002
we were only eleven, 
but acting like grownups like we are in the present 
drinking from plastic cups singing love is forever and ever
well, I guess that was true
dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
on an old mustang where we sang
songs with all our childhoos friends
and it went like this, say
oops I  got 99 problems singing bye,bye,bye
hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
better hit me baby one more time
