print('''summer has already spread in the air
breezes already blowing,
the last cold snap is going out
the days are getting longer and longer
my days were still going on and on and on,
i got wet in the sun shower,
looked up at the night sky,
it was quite a lonely night ,
in the blink of on a the dark faded out
blooming under the sunlight,
memories with me and you
all these lights are coloured in by you,
all these times are precious due to you,
four seasons i have passed with you,
four scents were left cause of you,
uhmmmmm
on a starry night,
hope my you sleep tight,
shining purple light,
THANKFUL TO BE BY YOUR SIDE NOW.''')
