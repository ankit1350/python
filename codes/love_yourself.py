print('''all the time that you rain on my parade
and all the clubs you get in using my name
you think you broke my heart 
ohh girl for goodness sake
you think im crying on my own
well i ani't
and i didn't wanna write a song
cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
Don't but you still hit my phone up
and baby i'll be moving on
and i think you should be something
i dont't wanna hold back
maybe you should know that
my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job
didn't see what's going on
and now i know 
i'm bette sleeping on my own''')
